# Employee Score Analysis
# Mongodb API Project

Welcome to my API Project that shows the results of employee scores from 3 different tests.

This API project is only GET requests, and you can request by many different filters.
Minimum marks to pass a term is 37 out of 100.

results.json is the results stored in my database.

How to use:

To start the app.js file, type `node .\app.js` into the terminal. To see the results of all employees, type
(http://localhost:3000/results) into your browser, or I prefer to do this in POSTMAN.
